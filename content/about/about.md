# 🚀 Welcome to Mili's Tech Journey!

Hey there, tech enthusiasts and wanderers of the digital realm! I'm Mili, a young and passionate developer on a quest to unravel the mysteries of the coding universe. 🌌

## The Passion for Innovation

Imagine a world where every line of code is a stroke on the canvas of innovation. That's the world I strive to create! Armed with a keyboard, a cup of coffee, and an insatiable curiosity, I embark on a journey through the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

## My Story

I cut my coding teeth in the fast-paced world of Novi Sad (currently), where every bug fix felt like a triumph, and every successful deployment was a victory parade. 🎉

### Professional Playground

I've had the incredible privilege of contributing my skills to groundbreaking projects at [Dfinity](https://dfinity.org/) and [Schneider Electric](https://www.se.com/ww/en/). At Dfinity, I delved into the world of decentralized computing with ICP, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the blockchain space and working mostly on SRE side of things learning how it all ties together. Then, at Schneider Electric, I harnessed the power of technology to drive sustainable energy solutions with some bad and good microservices. 🌐⚡

## The Tech Explorer

Join me on this thrilling expedition as we navigate through the vast expanse of coding galaxies. From the constellations of Rust to the black holes of everything else, I'm here to share my discoveries, insights, and the occasional coding escapade.

## Let's Connect!

<!-- 🐦 **[Twitter]:** Follow me on Twitter [@TBD] for live updates, memes, and maybe the occasional cat GIF! -->

<!-- 📷 **[Instagram]:** Explore the visual side of my coding adventures on Instagram [@YourInstagramHandle]. Spoiler: It involves lots of coffee and keyboard photos! -->

👨‍💻 **[GitHub]:** Peek into my code repository on GitHub [@nikolamilosa](https://github.com/NikolaMilosa). It's where the magic happens!

## Join the Quest!

Together, let's turn the ordinary into the extraordinary, one line of code at a time. Buckle up, fellow techies – this journey is bound to be a wild ride! The goal of this ride is to make me learn and have deep dives into simple and not so simple, into fresh and not so fresh and to finally embark on the voyage of knowledge. There is a lot that might come soon! 🚀✨

Cheers to endless lines of code and infinite possibilities!

Nikola Milosavljevic (Mili) 🌟
