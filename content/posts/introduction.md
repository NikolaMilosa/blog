As the title suggests... Hello! Each beginning is.. well.. hard? I've made it a question just so I make an excuse to discuss it. The whole idea of this blog came to mind because the year 2023 was a weird one for me. I didn't finish a bunch of stuff I wanted to and probably needed to and therefore decided to make this year (2024) a year of doing, growing and as you can see writing! 

I believe this blog will contain a lot of my ups, my downs, mistakes and laughs... I aim to give myself a topic each week and to have a deep dive in that topic with code, thoughts and suggestions. Now bare with me, I haven't been in this industry for long. Its been 3 years since typing my first production ready "Hello world!" and here I am already making a fuss about a blog.

I believe each and every developer should aspire to know more and what recent years show us we are more and more replacable and I believe that at least out of fear we should strive for knowledge. My personal goal is, well, to become nothing. I don't really care about my title or about my role. I've recently finished my Masters degree in Cyber Security and that is my passion. I am not going to write about it a lot probably, or maybe I am. Who knows... Time will tell.

I am also probably not going to go back to my posts and redo them because I think that its not fair. I want this blog to show my progress in this role and I don't want to mask any previous lack of knowledge or experience but I may or may not create aditional content that is going to laugh at and make fun of my previous posts.

One more thing is that I tend to be really opinionated. In general my whole persona is structured around being loud and if anything gets me fired that is it. So I may create some posts related to my opinions on ceratin topics and ongoings in the industry and what should or shouldn't be said.

I've had a chance to work at university and at my current role I am mentoring some students which I think is really necessary and would probably like to share that here as well. If this is read by any of you than I am sorry for all the mean things I say about our funny projects or something else, but hey, I may even invite some of you to write something on this blog.

Enough talk, lets have some real fun! üë®‚Äçüíª
